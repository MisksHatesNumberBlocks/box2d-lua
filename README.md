# Box2D
What is box2d?
-Box2d is a physics engine made in C++ which many users use it.

# Recreation in Lua
-I am trying to recreate this physics engine in lua, Except, the version im using it to make is on castle.xyz, because, this is made on a phone Note: obviously because some users that are viewing this is on a phone.
Hopefully this comes right ðŸ˜Ÿ
# Annoying Bugs
 -The thing is that the editor keeps copying the selected word to a random position which IS FREAKING ANNOYINGðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬
so this is why i wrote this file in Google Notes.
